Garbage Collection | When our game runs, it uses memory to store data. When this data is no longer needed, the memory that stored that data is freed up so that it can be reused. Garbage is the term for memory that has been set aside to store data but is no longer in use. Garbage collection is the name of the process that makes that memory available again for reuse.
