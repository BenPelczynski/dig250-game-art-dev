### Game Mechanics

> When it comes to the distinction between [game elements and mechanics], there are many interpretations of what they are and what they are made up of. ... when a player performs an action, they are likely to get something. This could range from a Badge, Point(s), Levels, or part of a Story. The "thing" that the player gets is what we will define as a "game element". 

> On the other hand, since game elements are the outcome, then the process of how we get them is what we will define as game mechanics. This could be anything from trading with other players, exploring mysterious worlds, and even Winning or Losing. Performing or engaging in these actions will result in obtaining game elements.
