### Terminology

Term | Definition
--- | ---
[Modifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/modifiers) | Modifiers are used to modify declarations of types and type members. 
[abstract](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/abstract) | Indicates that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes. Members marked as abstract, or included in an abstract class, must be implemented by classes that derive from the abstract class.
[const](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/const) | Constant fields and locals aren't variables and may not be modified. Constants can be numbers, Boolean values, strings, or a null reference. Donâ€™t create a constant to represent information that you expect to change at any time.
[override](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/override) |	Provides a new implementation of a virtual member inherited from a base class. It is required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, property, indexer, or event.
[static](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/static) |	Declares a member that belongs to the type itself instead of to a specific object.
[virtual](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual) |	Declares a method or an accessor whose implementation can be changed by an overriding member in a derived class.
[Access modifiers](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/scope-and-access-modifiers) | Access modifiers are keywords used to specify the declared accessibility of a member or a type. The three access modifiers you will see most often in C# are: `public` (access not restricted), `protected` (access limited to containing class or types derived from containing class), and `private` (access limited to the containing type). [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/access-modifiers).
