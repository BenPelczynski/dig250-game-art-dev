## Reference Sheet - Unity Tilemaps





### Terminology

Term | Definition
--- | ---
Tiles | Sprites that have been segmented or “sliced” into convenient dimensions and usually placed using a Tile Palette.
[Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CamerasOverview.html) | A game object with a Camera component that renders your players’ view of the game. Can be moved and repositioned (e.g. a "first-person shooter").
Camera Projection | The camera setting that renders objects with `perspective` intact (lines converge on the horizon) or `orthographic`, which renders objects uniformly, with no sense of perspective. ![orthographic vs perspective](https://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/CameraPerspectiveAndOrtho.jpg)
